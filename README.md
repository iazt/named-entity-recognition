# Named Entity Recognition


Sequence Labelling is a task of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Its main objective is to tag a sequence of tokens contained in a sentence.

On the other hand, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of Sequence Labelling and its principal goal is to identify and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, locations, time expressions, organizations, etc.

In this repository, different solutions are compared to solve a NER problem using a spanish database.

This is a task for the NLP course, CC6205 of the University of Chile. [Here](https://github.com/iazt/named-entity-recognition/blob/master/baseline.ipynb), you can find a baseline for the task, which is a basic solution created by the assistant professor Pablo Badilla.
