# Named Entity Recognition


Sequence Labelling is a task of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Its main objective is to tag a sequence of tokens contained in a sentence.

On the other hand, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of Sequence Labelling and its principal goal is to identify and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, locations, time expressions, organizations, etc.
